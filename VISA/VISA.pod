=head1 NAME

Lab::VISA - Perl interface to National Instrument's VISA library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lab::VISA;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library offers a perl interface to National Instrument's NI-VISA library.

With this library you can easily control the instruments in your lab (multimeters, voltage
sources, magnet sources, pulse generators etc.) from perl. You can perform
complicated measurement jobs with just some perl loops.

It comes even better. The general L<Lab::Instrument> class reduces the
communication overhead to a minimum. And the specialized instrument classes
(virtual instruments) like the L<Lab::Instrument::HP34401A> class offer
even more high level comfort. Everything is set up already, waiting for you to use it.

This manpage describes the perl syntax of the API. Each function is explained
with some sentences which I cited from [1]. See this manual for further
documentation on the library.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 viClear

    $status=Lab::VISA::viClear($vi);

The viClear() operation performs an IEEE 488.1-style clear of the device.

=head2 viClose

    $status=Lab::VISA::viClose($object);

The viClose() operation closes a session, event, or a find list. In this process all the data
structures that had been allocated for the specified vi are freed. Calling viClose() on a
VISA Resource Manager session will also close all I/O sessions associated with that resource
manager session.

=head2 viFindNext

    ($status, $instrDesc)=
        Lab::VISA::viFindNext($findList);

The viFindNext() operation returns the next device found in the list created by
viFindRsrc(). The list is referenced by the handle that was returned by viFindRsrc().

=head2 viFindRsrc

    ($status, $findList, $retcnt, $instrDesc)=
        Lab::VISA::viFindRsrc($sesn, $expr);

The viFindRsrc() operation matches the value specified in the expr parameter with the
resources available for a particular interface.

On successful completion, this function returns the first resource found (instrDesc) and
returns a count (retcnt) to indicate if there were more resources found for the designated
interface. This function also returns, in the findList parameter, a handle to a find list.
This handle points to the list of resources and it must be used as an input to viFindNext().
When this handle is no longer needed, it should be passed to viClose().

The search criteria specified in the expr parameter has two parts: a regular expression over
a resource string and an optional logical expression over attribute values. The regular
expression is matched against the resource strings of resources known to the VISA Resource
Manager. If the resource string matches the regular expression, the attribute values of the
resource are then matched against the expression over attribute values. If the match is
successful, the resource has met the search criteria and gets added to the list of resources
found.

All resource strings returned by viFindRsrc() will always be recognized by
viOpen(). However, viFindRsrc() will not necessarily return all strings that you can pass
to viParseRsrc() or viOpen(). This is especially true for network and TCPIP resources.

=head2 viGetAttribute

    ($status, $attrState)=
        Lab::VISA::viGetAttribute($object, $attribute);

The viGetAttribute() operation is used to retrieve the state of an attribute for the
specified session, event, or find list.

=head2 viOpen

    ($status, $vi)=
        Lab::VISA::viOpen($sesn, $rsrcName, $accessMode, $openTimeout);

The viOpen() operation opens a session to the specified resource. It returns a session
identifier that can be used to call any other operations of that resource. The address string
passed to viOpen() must uniquely identify a resource.

For the parameter accessMode, the value VI_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK (1) is used to acquire an
exclusive lock immediately upon opening a session; if a lock cannot be acquired, the session
is closed and an error is returned. The value VI_LOAD_CONFIG (4) is used to configure
attributes to values specified by some external configuration utility. Multiple access modes
can be used simultaneously by specifying a bit-wise OR of the values other than VI_NULL.
NI-VISA currently supports VI_LOAD_CONFIG only on Serial INSTR sessions.

=head2 viOpenDefaultRM

    ($status, $sesn)=
        Lab::VISA::viOpenDefaultRM();

The viOpenDefaultRM() function must be called before any VISA operations can be
invoked. The first call to this function initializes the VISA system, including the Default
Resource Manager resource, and also returns a session to that resource. Subsequent calls
to this function return unique sessions to the same Default Resource Manager resource.

When a Resource Manager session is passed to viClose(), not only is that session closed,
but also all find lists and device sessions (which that Resource Manager session was used to
create) are closed.

=head2 viRead

    ($status, $buf, $retCount)=
        Lab::VISA::viRead($vi, $count);

The viRead() operation synchronously transfers data. The data read is to be stored in the
buffer represented by buf. This operation returns only when the transfer terminates. Only one
synchronous read operation can occur at any one time.

=head2 viSetAttribute

    $status=Lab::VISA::viSetAttribute($vi, $attribute, $attrState);

The viSetAttribute() operation is used to modify the state of an attribute for the specified
object.

=head2 viWrite

    ($status, $retCount)=
        Lab::VISA::viWrite($vi, $buf, $count);

The viWrite() operation synchronously transfers data. The data to be written is in the buffer
represented by buf. This operation returns only when the transfer terminates. Only one
synchronous write operation can occur at any one time.

=head1 CAVEATS/BUGS

Probably many.

I have only tested this on Linux so far. It should work on Windows, provided that
you manage to run swig and compile the wrapper code.

Not all API functions are supported, just the ones that I needed. Only GPIB connections
are tested so far.
